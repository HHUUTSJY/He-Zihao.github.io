# Jewelry

## How often do you wear jewelry?

To be honest, I have never worn jewelry until now. I think it's a little difficult for me to choose some jewelries to match my appearance. I prefer a style of simple personal image instead of dress myself with too many wearing elements.

## What type of jewelry do you like best?

It's hard to say, as I know little about jewelry. Maybe finger rings is acceptable for me because it's easy to wear and doesn't attract others' eyes easily. However, something like earrings is not acceptable for me for I have to hurt myself for a hole to wear them.

## Have you ever given jewelry to someone as a gift?

No, I haven't. My appreciation to jewelry, that I'm not interested in jewelry, begins from my family and be cultivated in my living environment. Almost all the people around me dislike wear jewelry. So, giving jewelry as a gift is not a choice for me in common.

## Why do you think some people wear a piece of jewelry for a long time?

I think like clothing, jewelry is a part of a person's appearance. Some people can attract more people focus by wearing showy clothes as well as beautiful jewelry. For example, super stars will wear jewelry for their role building, I guess.
