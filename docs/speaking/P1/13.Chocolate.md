# Chocolate

## Do you like eating chocolate? Why/Why not?

Umm I think I don't like eating chocolate very much. They have a strange taste compared with the traditional snacks I have when I was a child. In addition, if chocolate tastes well, it usually means a lot of sugar are added into it, which means a little unhealthy.

## Did you often eat chocolate when you were a child?

Seldom. I can remember when I was a child, chocolate is an expensive snack. So not only my family but the friends around me can't eat chocolate often. Besides, there were fewer chocolate sold in shops at my child time than now. So, some children would ask chocolate as their birthday gift.

## Whatâ€™s your favorite flavor?

Umm, I'm not very familiar with chocolate, but I think the milk chocolate taste better. Milk chocolate taste sweet while the black chocolate is a little bitter, I remember.

## Do you think it is good to give others chocolate as gifts?

Yes. I think if I don't know send someone what as a gift, snack is a good choice. Chocolate is one snack more and more common nowadays. Chocolate with good taste can seldom make mistakes, as other gifts may be disliked or useless.

## Why do you think chocolate is popular around the world?

I think chocolate taste good and can be afford by many people now. Unlike my child time, we can access chocolate even in a small shop in the small town. As well as its sweet taste, many children enjoy them.
