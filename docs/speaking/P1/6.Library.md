# Library

## Do you often go to the library?

Yes, I often go to the library, especially when I'm at school. Library is an important place for me to get some information from books which is hard to access in the Internet. In addition, for the silent environment, I can more easily focus on writing or reading in library.

## What do you usually do in the library?

One most important thing is of course to borrow and read books, which are usually expensive or difficult to get in the other place. I usually write my homework or papers as well. It's easy for me to focus on my work for a whole day in the library.

## Did you go to a library when you were a kid?

To be honest, my primary school only had a reading room with a few books instead of a library like now. Even though, I enjoyed staying in the reading room when I were a kid, as there were still some very interesting books for children.

## Do children in your country often go to a library?

Yes, every time I go to a library, I can always see a lot of children reading or doing their homework. Library is an excellent place for children to focus on study. I think children nowadays have a much better environment for reading than I had when I were a child.
