# Small businesses

## Are there any famous small businesses in the area you live in?

Yes, it's a restaurant famous all the country town I live in. Hosted by a couple for several decades, noodles are the main dish of this restaurant. Because its dish so delicious, I nearly must eat at least once in my vocation. I can say, the taste of noodles from this restaurant is a part of my child's memory.

## Do you prefer buying things from small or big companies?

It depends on what I need to buy. Usually, the quality of expensive things like computers or cellphones can be guaranteed from big companies. But as for something cheap and common in life like food, I prefer that from small companies, as their commodities are usually cheaper with little difference between small and big companies.

## Have you ever worked in small businesses?

No, I haven't worked in any small business because I 'm still studying in school. Maybe it's an interesting experience but I can only focus on my studying.

## Have you ever thought about starting your own business?

Umm, to be honest, I have never thought about that. I prefer work in a school or a company instead of starting my own business, because I think I don't have enough ability to deal with various kind of problems of my business. I'm good at solve the technical issues but not the interpersonal issues.
