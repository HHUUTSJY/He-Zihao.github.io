Although I have not watched a lot of films, I can still remember some films really interesting, such as ET. In my memory, most of this kind of film is the science fiction film. So, they usually contain some magic and interesting things, which is a point catch my eyes.

## Do you want to go into outer space in the future?

Ha-ha, I'm not sure. Outer space is the strange environment for people. It means a lot of difficult and difference we will face if we go into outer space. Besides, only the person with a good body can stand the progress leaving from Earth. So, it's really a challenge for me.
