# Art

## Do you like art?

Yes, I like art, including painting, music and calligraphy(writing), as they can all show some kind of beauty which is hard to see in other places. For example, painting can show a very magic world that even doesn't exist in the real world.

## Have you ever visited an art gallery?

Of course, several art galleries I have visited, such as Nanjing Museum. It's a famous museum as well as an art gallery all over the nation, and also impresses me most, for so much art works which can represent the top level of art in the different historical stage of China.

## Do you want to be an artist?

Umm I don't think I will be an artis because I prefer to be a teacher or an engineer. To be honest, I'm not good at art as well, so I know little about the deep things beyond art. I think it's more suitable for me to appreciate art when I'm free as a part of relax method

## Do you like modern art or traditional art?

I think I prefer traditional art, as it can be understood more easily in my view. Some modern arts like Abstract Paintings are too difficult for me to know what the author want to describe and deliver to audience.
