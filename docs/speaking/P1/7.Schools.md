# Schools

## Where is your school?

Now I'm studying in Southeast University, located in Nanjing, a city of east China. Nanjing is a famous and flourishing(繁华的) city. But my school is far from the urban, so I have to spend more than half an hour to urban for a dinner or other entertainment.

## Do you like your school?

Yes of course. My school is a famous university throughout the country for its huge academic achievement. Most of my teachers are kind and professional, even some of them are well-known all over the world. In addition, the campus is so beautiful for its lake and a small meadow that many people called my school as a huge garden.

## Are you content with the learning atmosphere in your school?

Sure. I think the learning atmosphere in my school is very good. Maybe far from urban, we can focus on studying and researching, and get less disturb from other things. Because of my teacher's profession, I can get high quality of instruction of my researching. So, I'm very satisfied with the learning atmosphere in my school,

## Is there anything you want to change about your school?

I wish the style of building could be more various in my school. Nearly all the buildings are gray, lack of other colors. The same style without changes seems to be disagree with surrounding environment.
