# Keys

## Do you always bring a lot of keys with you?

Not always. I only take keys when I travel with a bag. If I just go for a short time, it's not convenient for me to take a lot of keys. They are too large and uncomfortable to put them into my pocket, and not convenient to hold them in my hands.

## Have you ever lost your keys?

In my memory, I have never lost my keys. I usually keep them on my bag and only take them out when I use them. Thus, my keys will not be lost only if I forget my bag. I think keys are very important so I should be careful for them.

## How can we avoid losing keys?

In my opinion, we can string them with a ring. Compared with every single key, a string of keys means bigger. As result, we will more difficult to ignore them. Once we remember the existence of keys, it's hard to losing keys.
