# Stay up late

## Do you often stay up late?

Oh yes. I often stay up for entertainment or work, because I usually feel more energetic at night. And the majority of the young are also used to stay up late for various reasons, I guess.

## What do you do when you stay up late?

Well, it depends on the time and my work progress. In the weekdays, I can meet deadlines of some works. So, I will usually work at night. However, the night at weekends is the time when I usually play games, watch videos, or other recreational activities.

## How do you feel when you have stayed up late the night before?

Oh, I usually get up late when I stay up late the night before. So, I will feel okay in the morning. But if I don't have enough time or a good quality of sleeping at night, I will be very tired or very easy to be angry. As result, I will usually stay up only when I am free the next morning.
