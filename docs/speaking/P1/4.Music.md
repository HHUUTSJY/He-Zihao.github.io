# Music

## Do you like music?

Yes, of course I do. I think music is a very magic thing that I can share the mood with others even though we are in different place and time stage. In addition, music is a good relax method that can make my life more energetic instead of just hard working.

## What kinds of music do you like to listen to?

It's hard to say because I listen to various style of music and I like them nearly all. For example, light music is a kind of music I often listen to, as it usually seems to be peaceful. And without lyrics, light music gives me a huge zone to imagine.

## Do you enjoy the same kind of music as your friends?

Yes, I share a lot of music with my friends. Folk music and pop music is the kind we often appreciate together. We will even sing some of them when we all have a high mood.

## Which singer or musician would you like to see in concert?

Oh, it's really a shame I haven't attended one concert. But I hope I can watch the concert from May Day, a famous band from Taiwan, because their songs are usually full of energy and motivate me during my middle school.
