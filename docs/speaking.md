# Part 1

## T-shirts

### Do you usually wear T-shirts?

Yes, I almost wear T-shirts all the summer. In fact, T-shirts are the most popular style of clothing all over the world among different ages, as it's so convenient and comfortable. It can be worn at both formal and informal situation.

### Do you like T-shirts with pictures or prints?

Well, I prefer T-shirts with pure color rather than that with pictures or prints. Because I think it's more suitable for me to dress in some simple styles. I have to be more careful to make my wearing seem to be harmonious if there are too many elements in my clothes.

### Do you think older people are fashionable if they wear T-shirts?

I don't think so. As I just said, T-shirts are very common in different ages. There are indeed so many people around me, no matter the younger or the elder, will wear T-shirts in summer. Maybe some elements, such as special pictures, in clothing can show a person's fashion.

### Have you ever bought T-shirts as souvenirs?

Emmm... In my memory I have not bought that as souvenirs and in fact I don't like too many pictures or words on my T-shirts. T-shirts as souvenirs usually have some certain sign on them, which will be not suitable in some occasions, especially in formal.

## Stay up late

### Do you often stay up late?

Oh yes. I often stay up for entertainment or work, because I usually feel more energetic at night. And the majority of the young are also used to stay up late for various reasons, I guess.

### What do you do when you stay up late?

Well, it depends on the time and my work progress. In the weekdays, I can meet deadlines of some works. So, I will usually work at night. However, the night at weekends is the time when I usually play games, watch videos, or other recreational activities.

### How do you feel when you have stayed up late the night before?

Oh, I usually get up late when I stay up late the night before. So, I will feel okay in the morning. But if I don't have enough time or a good quality of sleeping at night, I will be very tired or very easy to be angry. As result, I will usually stay up only when I am free the next morning.
