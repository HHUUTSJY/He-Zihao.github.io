# A tool for connecting to the demodulator

The self-developed software needs to directly obtain the data from the fiber optic sensor demodulator, so it needs to convert and display the data independently in real time. In order to test, a tool to connect to the demodulator is designed, which can be applied to specific models of FBG demodulators, distributed fiber optic demodulators and other sensors. The tool is programmed based on C++ Qt, which can provide help for real-time data acquisition in health monitoring tasks.
