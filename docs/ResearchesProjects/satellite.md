# Model updating and load identification of satellite structures

Material parameters of a satellite structureâ€™s finite element model were updated according to the natural frequency from experiments. Then based on B-spline functions, the method of annularly distributed dynamic load identification was proposed, which was used to reconstructed the load at the bottom of satellite.
