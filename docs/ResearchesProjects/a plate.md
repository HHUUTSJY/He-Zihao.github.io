# Load identification and software for a plate

This is my first research. First, a finite element model was constructed, and the identification algorithm based on Green's function was verified by simulation. Then, the finite element model was updated based on the mode tests. Finally, the dynamic load from vibration exciter was accurately identified, and the noise was suppressed by a regularization method.
