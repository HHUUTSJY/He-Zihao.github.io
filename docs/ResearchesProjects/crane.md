# Crane beam fatigue test

The project required a fatigue life analysis of crane girders in a steel plant. First, a finite element model was constructed to analyze the response under moving loads, and compared with the measured results to verify the accuracy of the model. This allowed my colleague to perform fatigue analysis on the finite element model to estimate life.
