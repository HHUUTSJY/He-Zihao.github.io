# About me

I’m a postgraduate student from Southeast University majoring in dynamical mechanics. My research interests is mainly about inverse problems of dynamic. And I also find neural networks and deep learning is very magic so I would like to learn some about them. Good experimental skills, such as measuring strain by Fiber Bragg Grating(FBG) Sensor, also help me succeed in several projects.
